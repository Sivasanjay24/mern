  <p class="abt">I’m a third-year Computer Science student with a strong foundation in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), Database Management Systems (DBMS), and coding. My expertise in Full Stack Development allows me to build scalable web applications, handling both front-end and back-end development efficiently. I have experience working with various frameworks, databases, and cloud technologies to create dynamic and user-friendly applications. Additionally, I have a basic understanding of Computer Networks (CN) and Operating Systems (OS), which helps me grasp system-level operations and networking concepts.  
    I enjoy problem-solving, optimizing algorithms, and continuously exploring new technologies to enhance my skills. Whether it’s participating in coding challenges, working on personal projects, or staying updated with industry trends, I’m always eager to learn and improve. My goal is to apply my knowledge to real-world applications, contribute to innovative solutions, and grow as a well-rounded software developer.</p>
